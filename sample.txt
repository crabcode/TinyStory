* Where am I?
    You're in your room.
    
    * What do I hear?
        You hear the wind blowing through the trees outside.
    * What do I feel?
        A slight sense of dread.
    * What do I see?
        [WhatIsee]
            There's a ghost in your room.

            * How long has it been there?
                For three days.
            * How do I feel about that?
                Not great.
            * What is it doing?
                It just stands there in the corner, watching you.
            * What do I do?
                [WhatIdo]
                    What do you want to do?
                    
                    * Can I talk to it?
                        Sure. What do you want to say?
                        
                        * "What do you want?"
                            It doesn't answer.
                        * "Go away!"
                            It doesn't move.
                        * "Who are you?"
                            It doesn't say.
                        * Can I try something else?
                            > WhatIdo
                    * Can I ignore it?
                        Of course. Do you want to?
                        
                        * Yes
                            The ghost keeps watching you, and you keep ignoring it. You continue this game until the end of days.
                            < End

                    * Can I call someone?
                        [CanIcall]
                            Who you gonna call?
                            
                            * Can I call the Ghostbusters?
                                They're not real.
                            * Can I call my mom?
                                Your mom is dead.
                                
                                * Is that who the ghost is?
                                    I don't know. Does it look like your mom?
                                    
                                    * Yes, actually.
                                        Then that's who that ghost is.
                                        
                                        * So now what?
                                            [NowWhat]
                                                Well, you need to figure out what she wants.
                                                
                                                * How do I do that?
                                                    Think. Why might she be here with you?
                                                    
                                                    * Because she loved me?
                                                        Of course she did. That goes without saying.
                                                    * Because something is wrong?
                                                        No reaction. I don't think that's it.
                                                    * Because it's my fault she died?
                                                        Her expression changed. I think you're getting close.
                                                        
                                                        * Is she angry?
                                                            No, she's not.
                                                        * Is she sad?
                                                            Yes, she looks sad.
                                                            
                                                            * Because she died?
                                                                No, she seems at peace with that.
                                                            * Because I did this to her?
                                                                She shakes her head.
                                                            * Because I blame myself?
                                                                That's it. She seems heartbroken to hear you say that.
                                                                
                                                                * But it was my fault...
                                                                    No, it wasn't. You did nothing wrong.
                                                                    
                                                                    * But if I hadn't...
                                                                        [ButIf]
                                                                            Stop. It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Sometimes these things just happen. Making yourself miserable over something you had no control over won't bring her back.

                                                                                [Forgive]
                                                                                    You need to forgive yourself.
                                                                                    
                                                                                    * I will.
                                                                                        The ghost disappears. You did it! Now go on, live your life and be happy. It's what she wanted. Good luck.
                                                                                        < End

                                                                                        Blaming yourself won't do any good.

                                                            Never.
                                                        * Is she scared?
                                                            I don't think so, no.
                                                
                                    * Not really.
                                        Then no.

                            * Can I call an exterminator?
                                Yes. The exterminator makes an appointment with you for the next day.
                                
                                * Is it the next day yet?
                                    Yes. It's the next day and the exterminator comes by.
                                    
                                    * Does she see the ghost?
                                        No. But that just means that it haunts you personally and not your home, so it's normal.
                                    * What does she do?
                                        Asking you questions. Exterminating a ghost isn't as simple as vacuuming it up. You need to find out who it is and what they want.
                                        
                                        * What does she need to know?
                                            First of all, does the ghost look familiar?
                                            
                                            * Is it my dad?
                                                Your dad is still alive. You'd know that if you called every once in a while.
