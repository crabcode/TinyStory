* Where am I?
    You're in your room.
    
    * What do I hear?
        You hear the wind blowing through the trees outside.
    * What do I feel?
        A slight sense of dread.
    * What do I see?
        There's a ghost in your room.

        * How long has it been there?
            For three days.
        * How do I feel about that?
            It's not great.
        * What does it look like?
            Ghostly.
        * What is it doing?
            It just stands there in the corner, watching you.
        * What do I do?
            What do you want to do?
            
            * Can I talk to it?
                Sure. What do you want to say?
                
                * "What do you want?"
                    It doesn't answer.
                * "Go away!"
                    It doesn't move.
                * "Who are you?"
                    It doesn't say.
                * Can I try something else?
                    > What do I do?
            * Can I ignore it?
                Of course. Do you want to?
                
                * Yes.
                    The ghost keeps watching you, and you keep ignoring it. You continue this game until the end of days.
                    < End
                * No.
                    > What do I do?
            * Can I call someone?
                Who you gonna call?
                
                * Can I call the Ghostbusters?
                    They're not real.
                * Can I call my mom?
                    Your mom is dead.
                    
                    * Is that who the ghost is?
                        I don't know. Does it look like your mom?
                        
                        * Yes, actually.
                            Then that's who that ghost is.
                            
                            * So now what?
                                Well, you need to figure out what she wants.
                                
                                * How do I do that?
                                    Think. Why might she be here with you?
                                    
                                    * Because she loved me?
                                        Of course she did. That goes without saying.
                                    * Because something is wrong?
                                        No reaction. I don't think that's it.
                                    * Because it's my fault she died?
                                        Her expression changed. I think you're getting close.
                                        
                                        * Is she angry?
                                            No, she's not.
                                        * Is she sad?
                                            Yes, she looks sad.
                                            
                                            * Because she died?
                                                No, she seems at peace with that.
                                            * Because I did this to her?
                                                She shakes her head.
                                            * Because I blame myself?
                                                That's it. She seems heartbroken to hear you say that.
                                                
                                                * But it was my fault...
                                                    No, it wasn't. You did nothing wrong.
                                                    
                                                    * But if I hadn't...
                                                        Stop. It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Sometimes these things just happen. Making yourself miserable over something you had no control over won't bring her back.
                                                        
                                                        * Fine. So what do I do now?
                                                            You need to forgive yourself.
                                                            
                                                            * I will.
                                                                Look! The ghost is gone. You did it! Now go on, live your life and be happy.
                                                                < End
                                                            * I can't.
                                                                Blaming yourself won't do you any good.
                                                                < Fine. So what do I do now?
                                                        * But...
                                                            > But if I hadn't...
                                        * Is she disappointed?
                                            Never.
                                        * Is she scared?
                                            I don't think so, no.
                                
                        * Not really.
                            Then no.
                            = mom false
                            
                            * So what do I do?
                                > What do I do?
                                
                    * Can I call someone else?
                        > Can I call someone?
                        
                * Can I call an exterminator?
                    Yes. The exterminator makes an appointment with you for the next day.
                    
                    * Is it the next day yet?
                        Yes. It's the next day and the exterminator comes by.
                        
                        * Does she see the ghost?
                            No. But that just means that it haunts you personally and not your home, so it's normal.
                        * What does she do?
                            Asking you questions. Exterminating a ghost isn't as simple as vacuuming it up. You need to find out who it is and what they want.
                            
                            * What does she need to know?
                                First of all, does the ghost look familiar?
                                
                                * Is it my dad?
                                    Your dad is still alive. You'd know that if you called every once in a while.

                                    * Is it my mom?
                                        I think so, yes.

                                        You already said it wasn't, so no.
                                * Is it my brother?
                                    You don't have a brother.
                                * Is it my sister?
                                    I think so, yes.

                                    * So now what do I do?

                * back
                    > What do I do?
            * back
                > What do I see?
        * back
            > Where am I?
